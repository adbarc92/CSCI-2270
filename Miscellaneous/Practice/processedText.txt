 recollection january 13th presenti think it was raining on the day it started at least in hindsight that seems like the beginningi was sitting in homeroom next to ellioti wouldnt exactly call him my best friend but hes the friend ive known the longest and yes my high school does have a homeroom period most people comment on that but its not the weirdest thing about my high school sunnington ridge recognize it most people do its one of the most exclusive and prestigious high schools in the worldto the point that its proper name is the sunnington ridge institution for erudition and mastery although ive always thought it would be more honest if it was for the biggest bank accounts its student population consists entirely of sons and daughters of prominent politicians wealthy foreign dictators ceos and frontrunners of fortune 500 companies and generally the top 00001% of planet earth the yearly tuition approaches seven figures and stimulants like coke and speed are traded more freely and liberally than gum is at normal high schools the student body is quite competitivethe schools slogan is shaping and guiding the brightest minds of humanitys futureim getting distracted thoughlets get back to elliot our families have been neighbors for longer than i can remember so we spent plenty of time together growing up since then ive come to appreciate elliot for entirely different reasons his dad is the ceo of an exceedingly prominent pharmaceutical company no im not going to specify which onehis dad guards his familys privacy very jealously it took years before elliot was willing to tell me and elliot had bruises for the next couple days after his dad found out that i knewnever anywhere visible though his dads a smart guyhe personally formulates most of the drugs his company sells from what i can telloddly enough despite how seriously he takes some things elliots dad has never been anything but generous with drugs in regards to elliot in his words he only sees them as different combinations of chemicals and hed rather i get them from him so he knows what i use is safe that attitude has made elliot one of the de facto dealers in our school everyone here has the connections but elliot can get such rare substances in significant quantities with very little noticehes a pretty useful friend to have plus we tend to get along pretty wellso in homeroom that dayand keep in mind that this is about four months backelliot turns around and excitedly starts talking about this new formula his dads been excited about and its one that might help my conditionive been a paraplegic since before i was born doctortypes call it a congenital anomaly which basically means that they have no real idea about whats going on and it happened before i was born ive seen some of the best medical practitioners in the world and the most they could tell me was that its neurological i have no muscular abnormalities other than atrophy from disuse from what they can tell so why cant i just get up out of my wheelchair and walk one guy took it so personally when he couldnt figure it out that he cut my leg pretty severely when i wasnt looking just so that he could catch me in my lie he sewed me up free of charge and apologized profusely to my father who was livid im pretty convinced that my father either ruined his career or had him wacked nonetheless i feel bad for the guy but my father has a pretty serious temper and hes never let me live down the neurological nature of my conditionso elliot offers to get me some of this stuff if im interested and i am its been through very rigorous clinical trials but fda regulations are so strict that its only about halfway to market the only side effects that people have experienced are strange dreams and it has no physiological addictivenessalthough i was already willing to try it before elliot told me any of thatturns out he knew i would agree which meant that right before i went to sleep that night i popped open the container and downed two of the big red circular pills looking back that might have been a mistake despite the fact that im well aware that going above and beyond prescribed dosage is never a good idea ive always been an enthusiastic person apart from taking the pills i fell asleep the same way i always dothe first night september 8th pastnext thing i know im opening my eyes to a room that isnt minemore specifically its not even a roomim outside staring up at a bloodred sky with navyblue clouds arrayed around an open circle as though theyve been recently gathered by a tornadothe next thing i notice is that my body feels…different very different i flex my hands and theyre strong and powerful my grasp feels so firm that if i got ahold of something it could never escape in fact id be worried it might break crushed within my handsbut that sensation makes sense to meive grasped things before just never with such intensity such vigor this makes the feeling somewhat familiari turn my attention to an entirely different unfamiliar set of sensations inside my head it feels as though my brain has grown an entirely new neurological network i prod at it a bit and feel an impossible twinge i crane my neck forward so that i can confirm it with my eyes one of my feet twitches its not exactly painful but its too foreign for me to feel comfortable with it then i realize that part of me is dissociatedremoved from the sensation of experiencing merely observing and documenting im acutely aware of how much i do not want to get attached even to the concept of this occurrence after all of the bitter days and sleepless nights the dwindling hope of this possibility had envenomed me and was threatening to consume me i would never be able to conceive of myself as a whole person only a mistakenly broken toyand then my foot trembles againim shaken out of my reverie by a series of loud intrusive noises my ears hone in on them with an uncanny precisionyet they also feel as though id never really used them beforeim surrounded by screaming intermingled with yelling or maybe the other way around interspersed among the voiceswhich are nearly constanti detect the occasional boom at the time i didnt think of them as explosions because i dont remember ever hearing what one sounded like in person only in movies later id discover thats exactly what they werebut im getting ahead of myself againi scramble to my feet using instincts i didnt know i had my mind was making wellknown to me an acute and ravenous desire for cover for protection despite my sincerest attempts to assuage it and talk it into moving away from the ledge rather than leaping off into the abyss of fear and making a mesized splat on the sidewalk my reptile brain was fully in control panic was beginning to climb up my throat and claw its way outeven as my memories of waking life have faded growing wan and colorless my recollection of events in the dreameven now i dont really know what to call ithas always remained both vivid and pristine yet that moment of utmost terror and despair…that is one of very few that has never quite left me that was when i learned what it was to truly be afraid something that i am convinced most people will never quite understandi whipped my head around wildly my vision was starting to tunnel no cover no defense no protection no safetyeverywhere everything around me was in ruin bodies strewn with no design or order dismembered limbstorn or messily chopped distended intestinesboth fetid and fresh husks of structuresburned or smashed crumbling monuments and pockmarked roadssouvenirs of humanitys shortlived foray into hostile territory this land where blood flowed more ubiquitously and freely than water ever could have how many people does it take to paint the world red with blood at an average of oneandahalf gallons per human being… i caught my mind redhandedno pun intendedin the act of trying to estimate the number visually as though it were working through a math problem i reeled it back inwhatever was going on here i was isolated at least for the moment which meant i had time not very much but precious little is infinitely better than none the battleor was it a slaughter i couldnt tell at this distancewasnt within arms length which meant that this area was not currently being contested was that because the opposing force thought theyd already killed everyone or was it because their battle lines had surged forward and this was no longer disputed territory were the enemies attempting to take ground or simply slaughter everyone they could findon every horizon i could make out vague contours of individual bodies crashing against one another clumped in groups i couldnt discern any distinguishable battle lines it seemed as though dozens of looselyorganized squads of fivetoten were engaging similarlysized opposition completely independently of each other as though a dozen units were waging war on each other coincidentally in the same placeat this point i was struck by the oddness of my minds workings id never studied battle tactics or warfare academically i excelled in mathematics and history with no particular interest in warfarewhich incidentally made me something of an anomaly among other males who shared my academic inclinationthe juxtaposition of my life as a cripple against my present situation strained my mind panic began to set in anew i returned my attention to the battlefield for reasons both psychological and pragmaticthere were no sounds of popping or sudden flashes to indicate gunfirei wasnt ready to handle the why of that so i set it aside for the time beingso i assumed looking for a firearm was out of the question not that i knew how to handle one at any rate regardless i still needed a weapon time to scavengelooking back im still astonished that it took me so long to realize that id been naked this whole time in my defense i can only say that the prospect of moving feet was far more fascinating to me than my dick wasalthough now that id noticed it dawned on me that an entirely new world of possibilities had suddenly been made available to me my next thought was that i probably shouldnt be thinking about that at the moment seeing as it would be irrelevant once more if i died herethe human mind is an odd thing like that from starttofinish of this first dream it never occurred to me to question the ramifications of death or harm to my waking self when the mind of animals is presented with the prospect of an unexpectedly sudden and typically painful departure from this mortal coil it acknowledges only one thing survival at any cost and at all costs it is a singular feeling beautiful in its own wayit is as though the world itself is contingent upon your ability to perceive it without you nothing else matters were the world to suffer the indignity of being deprived of you it would have no alternative save to burni stole around the perimeter quickly snatching a pauldron here and a vambrace there my takings left me with both the guilt of wrongdoing and the perverse satisfaction of thievery when and where had i learned the names for various pieces of armor maybe a video game or a book i couldnt recall registering such information at least not consciouslyi tried not to ignore the faces and states of people i was stealing from i kept trying to repeat that onceclever aphorism that one cannot truly steal from the dead for they have no future use for material possessions i wasnt having much luck convincing myself their unblinking glazed eyes were accusatory and every gaze condemned me further that feeling never really went awayi was forced to move from bodytobody because none of the corpses sported a complete set of armor very rarely did any one persons armor matchit was as though each had cobbled together a patchwork their personal history of battles fought and deaths thwarted…until now and when they had fallen their fellows had combed the land out of either desperation or necessity cutting away others patches to fill in the gaps they were missing while i worked with the mechanical efficiency inherent to distasteful labor my mind was idly wondering if those who had taken the armor had done so with contempt or reverenceafter ten bodiesonly one of whom had been a woman my mind observedi was forced to seek out another cluster of corpses i was missing what was debatably the most important piece a brigandine the breastplate other variants of chest pieces would have worked somehow i felt a strong inexplicable inclination toward that particular typeand even if i wanted to i couldnt have pillaged chest pieces from these corpses each was mangledsome bashed in which would have crushed the ribs and almost certainly punctured a lung while others were carved into from the sides or punched through littered with holes nothing i knew of had the physical strength to do something like that i noticed that while the armor appeared to be wrought from gold or silver underneath a thin layer of each layer was another metal it was embedded deeply enough that chips or scratches wouldnt be enough to render it visible i found that while i was quite familiar with general metallurgy my knowledge found no purchase on this newlyrevealed metal it was colored similarly to silver with a hint of an offblue vaguely reminiscent of platinum except that the color seemed to shift nearly imperceptibly as light caught it differentlywhen i moved to touch it the vambrace adorning my forearm began to vibrate slightly humming with a steady determination that struck me as akin to magnetism except that i found no repulsion or attraction perhaps the exterior material was dampening the effecti caught myself wondering when i needed to be moving my damned curiosity was going to be the end of mei followed a misshapen line of bricksremnants of a sidewalk or its equivalent no doubtto an area that looked to be a former town square skeletal houses and ruined shops with deeply flawed brick roads jutting out from the center in several different directions where the roads met there was a fountainor what was left of one the spout was missing its tophalf and looked to be comprised of a man and a woman standing very close to one another it was tough to tell as only their legs remained the spray pool was chipped sporadically with a single hideouslylarge gash on one side courtesy of a stillembedded gigantic battle axe blood flowed lethargically around its edges gathering in a pool that left the ground stained as it seeped through to the soilcreeping closer constantly aware of the nearby echoes of mortalityhad they gotten closer i couldnt tell if it was just my imaginationi found what i was looking forstill leaning against the fountains spout was a corpse twisted and broken as though he was an action figure to which a sadistic child had taken a hammer the arms and legs were splayed at odd anglesbent at unnatural angles as though tested to see how much stress they could bear before buckling perched atop his pristine breastplate was what remained of a head his skull had been caved in to such an extent that his face was rendered entirely unrecognizable and his brains had settled into an equilibrium that satisfied physics half inside his head and half a rankling colorless tendril that had drizzled irresponsibly down into the fountain he looked as though hed been casually dashed against the fountain the force of which had apparently liquefied his grey matterexcessively conscious of the metaphorical clock callously ticking my life away i hopped into the fountain and began working furiously at undoing the clasps and straps that bound my means of survival to a corpse the carnage of a battlefield fabricates a smell the likes of which can never be properly described only experiencedblood unwashed and often infected flesh and feces drift through ones nose amidst other awful stencheshowever the smell of decaying brain matter is still quite distinctivei wrested the breastplate away from my fallen comradei couldnt help but think of him as suchand shrugged it on over and around my shoulders it was no brigandine but it offered my back some protection which made it vastly superior to the cuirasses id come across earlier it would suit my purposes nicelyin the back of my mind lay a muted surprise at the fact that i didnt recognize this type of armor offhand it was vaguely reminiscent of european chain mail but the forged curves of the links rendered it visibly eastern in origin it was bound on one side that i could only assume was the back however i didnt have the luxury of putting it on at my leisure nor i was convinced was i flexible enough to do it solono wonder why knights needed damned squiresmy fingers nimbly threaded the clasps and tightened the straps at the top and bottom as though id been doing this my whole lifeas if it had been waiting on me to properly prepare myself the sky was suddenly lit with a vast brilliance that struck down through the center opening of the clouds piercing the earth below it gave the otherworldly impression that the circulating clouds formed the barrel of gigantic cannon in the sky and it had just fired a shot what did that meanon cue an echoing twisted grinding noise resounded from behind me accompanied and punctuated by thick thunderous stomps i could feel the stones beneath my feet vibrate rhythmically in time to the sound of the ground giving way slightly underfoot three beasts the likes of which no human could have laid eyes on emerged from the side of the clearing opposite me i had an instant before they would spot me i felt utterly convinced that no human could have laid eyes on them for if they had men would have set to killing each other to save them the awful inevitable demise these creatures promised maybe i could dive behind the fountain and hide until they leftim convinced that a considerable part of why im still alive to relate this story is because my body tensed up leaving me frozen to that spot as to why i still cannot quite say it was a combination of mortal anxiety and curiosity but there was something else to it as well… an excitement a thrill kneaded so deeply into me that its carved into my bones… caught between those feelings i couldnt bring myself to move in the interim ive learned that theynaming them here would utterly pointless because as far as ive been able to discern the name has no significance or meaning in any human language and is comprised of several letters that cannot be directly translated into english they have a strange alphabetthe beasts as i shall refer to them value…honor not in either the traditional or contemporary sense they seem to draw a very significant distinction between a warrior fighting alone and a group of two or more fighting togetherthe size of the beasts is what struck me firstthe shortest of them was nearly fifteen feet tall which made the nearby dwellings look like the faux houses used by children playing at adulthood their other features were stranger still they were entirely covered in black fur although the skin beneath was red patches of hair were matted down by fresh sticky blood the contrast was disquieting they looked as though theyd had a playful splash fight using human blood rather than water the contours of shapely muscles seemed emphasized rather than eclipsed by the fur and none of them looked to have much fat if anyeach beast had a muzzle and snout like that of a bear or leopard except far more exaggerated two horns stood proudly atop the head of each their eyes were completely redthey all sniffed at the air nearly in unison and then all three turned to focus on me who was becoming increasingly aware of the fact that in my haste i hadnt gotten around to finding a decent weaponof the three one stood slightly ahead of the others so i assumed him to be the leader the leader opened his mouth and emitted the twisted grinding noise id heard just before after a moment the other two joined in mimicking the noise i realized that this was their equivalent of laughter and was suddenly caught between annoyance at myself for not realizing it before and horror at what would come nextthe leader made several other noiseswhich must have been their language although i couldnt make anything of itand then lifted one hand and waved the other two offhis message was clear to me oneonone to them humans are weak pathetic and unworthy of survival just as it is no significant achievement for a human to kill insects or rodents there would be no prestige to be gained from three of them killing a single measly humanas the leader approached i noticed that he had three scars along the left side of his face off in the distance i caught a last glance at one of the beasts as they retreated only one scar it looked exactly the same length although obviously i was in no position to measure it with each step i could see it in his eyes that the leader was studying me it was clear that he was intelligent though to what extent i could only guesshe opened his mouth and began to emit a series of harsh guttural sounds it took me a moment to realize that he was attempting to communicate with me although to this day i still dont understand any of their language perhaps he was speaking for his own sake rather than mineand then the beast roared and charged toward meid never seen something so large move so quickly the beast lunged toward me one enormous hand outstretched i threw myself toward my only chance the gigantic axe embedded in the fountainmy armor was light enoughor maybe it was that i was strong enoughthat i rolled smoothly if uncomfortably to my feet next to the wicked battle axe the axes head was about the size of my torso with a smaller spike sticking out on the opposite side as a counterbalance if id thought it through i certainly would have gone for any other weapon the landscape was littered with broken or chipped swords and spears with the occasional novelty weapon none of them were perfect but at least i could actually have swung thoseanother roar i knew the beast was nearly upon me my hand closed around the heavy wooden haft it was big enough that even my large hands couldnt completely envelope itand then i pulled it free from the fountaini was so taken aback by my success that i staggered backward with the unexpected weight the beasts claws passed right overheadoffbalancehed overcommitted anticipating my failurei saw something akin to fear in the beasts expression goodi brought my strength to bear and with a roar of my own i swung the axe down overhead splitting the beasts head and cleaving halfway down his massive torso i pulled the axe free as his nowlifeless body went limp then collapsedthe remainder of that first dream was a tawdry affair it turned out that there was a network of tunnels concealed beneath the fountain that had been revealed when i lifted the axe i replaced the axe found a more modest weapon and dug through the smoking wreckage of buildings until i found a trap door leading down into tunnels i did my best to cover my tracks then moved through the dark tunnels until i found a veritable bunker the network of tunnels was surprisingly elaborate with small offshoots that led to wooden doors behind one of which i found a bed and some rationsi closed my eyes within the nightmareand found myself back in the waking worldi would later learn that sleeping wasnt the only way out but it was certainly the first i discoveredthe point of this story however is something that i noticed while preparing for schooli could feel ones of my toes begin to wiggle involuntarilyinterrogation january 13th presentthat should be enough for now the man said curtly he stood his metal chair screeching backward against the concrete floor he leaned forward slightly over the matching metallic table we will take an hourlong recess would you like anything water perhapsid like to be able to leave i said trying to keep the heat out of my voicewell get around to that first i believe there is more to the story much morei sat in silence this day would be just like all the resthe moved to the heavy door turned the knob and swung it openhe moved out into the hallway darkened by intermittent flickering of the lights break january 13th presentive been detained under tenuouslylegal circumstances for about a week now and after what happened two weeks ago i dont blame them news reports are still trickling in about previouslyundiscovered storehouses or warehouses filled with dead bodies i keep hoping that one of my six will be discoveredalthough im not sure how id identify thembut so far there arent any survivors at least not publiclyafter all of the drama at school and at home this reprieve had seemed a relief now… i wasnt sure how long theyd keep me that prospect alone did not worry me terribly it might take time but i knew that my father would find me even if he wanted to kill me he would want to do it himself that said were i to die here and now theres no amount of money that could bring me backif they wanted to do that there wasnt much i could do to stop them i could probably handle one or two realistically but id have to face many more than that before i found this facilitys exit and sooner or later id run into someone who was armed and very much not on my sideeither way the answer was the same if i truly wanted to survive there was nothing to do except wait and play their gameinterrogation january 13th presentthe doorknob began to turn as the lock clicked open the door swung open slowly revealing the same man that id been talking to before he wore a nametag which he displayed with a suspicious prominence it read agent wells claims specialist he was the only person id seen in my time here hell he might be the sole occupant of this facility or maybe this wasnt even the same facility id voluntarily walked into what seemed like an eternity ago this room was quickly becoming my entire world floors and walls of stone blocks all painted the same monotonous gray on the wall behind the chair where wells always sat was a decorative tapestry on one wall that depicted an eagle seizing a live raven from the air in its talons while carrying a dead snake in its mouth ive spent so much time sitting across from wells at this damned table that ive gotten pretty familiar with the weavingit hasnt gotten any less creepy than it was when i got herei have grown much more interested in what wells gets to look at a massive blackened screen set into the wall it reminds me of my wallmounted tv back at home except this one makes me feel far more uncomfortable it also reminds me of oneway mirrors often featured in crime showseveryone stands behind it and watches the suspect discussing how hes going to be brought down because everyoneincluding the vieweralready knows that hes guiltywells walked across the room in quick precise strides it took him two stridesno more no less and it never varies for some reason hed changed his tie but otherwise he looked exactly the same as he always does a fine threepiece suitobviously expensive although i could never quite make out which brand it waswith his dirtyblond hair slicked back his face couldnt seem to contort itself into any expression apart from a welcoming smile or a malicious glower right now it was the former but it was impossible to tell how long that would lastalright he said cheerfully i hope youve used your break time efficiently because well need to jump right back into it you have plenty of story left to tell and we have more clientsahem that is to say associates like yourselfleft to interview than we can handle at presentafter one conversation with him id been able to tell that he really liked the word efficiency he liked it to the extent that he used it whenever he could even when he shouldnt because it wasnt applicableyes i said impatiently but first i need to know when ill be allowed to leavehe knit his fingers as though he were seriously considering the prospect well mr shaddox that is entirely up to you the first time i heard that answer id been excited by it now i knew exactly where this was going when you agreed to relate your experience for the wellbeing of others adversely affected by the chemical compound designated t15c8 you signed a legally binding contract it states thati have agreed to relate my experiences in as much detail as possible until such a time that my consultation is deemed to be of no further value or benefit i finished for him yes i understand that will i be required to relate every single day of the past four months before you are satisfiedi do not appreciate being interrupted wells growled grinding his teeth then he forced a grin which looked menacing with his jaw clenched so tightly we will continue until we have reached a point whereupon it is of no further interestlook i said irreverently this would be much more efficient for all parties if you would just tell me what it is that youre looking for then i can skip straight to that piece well be done youll get what you want and i can go home i was hoping that his buzzword might subcommunicate some sort of trustworthiness as though it were an inside jokei believe we left off before school on the second day he prompted i blinked his teeth were no longer clenched he gave no indication of how irritated he had seemed just a few seconds agoi was impressed this guy had good selfcontrol i rolled my eyes and then began my tale anewrecollection january 13th presentthe next day at school i confronted elliot about my nightmare well confronted is a strong wordi wasnt quite ready to let anyone know that id experienced what could be a mild psychosis while i was asleep the next morning during our homeroom he asked me if id taken the medication and if it did anything id had an answer preparedalthough i have no idea what it was at this pointbut that melted very quickly he was just trying to help me…could i really lie to him id never been a deceptive person ive found that its often just easier to tell the truth because there are fewer things to keep track of that way remembering which lie id told who has always seemed like a lot of unnecessary work to methat said i couldnt tell him the whole truth so i told him that id taken it last night and had an unusual dream then had awoken to find that i felt a little different i wasnt even ready to talk about that placeat least not yet the sensations of war and death were still very present to me it was as though i expected the walls and ceiling of my classroom to collapse toppling askew as though real life were a movie set full of obscenely perfect props this was a stage and we were all putting on a play and sooner or later our movie set would crumble around us as the curtains fell and id be thrust back into the real world it was inevitable that once again i would be crushed beneath that palpable terror as i struggled feebly against inhuman horrors none of this was reali wasnt prepared to address the reality that outlook demanded and so i couldnt have told elliot even if id wanted to he seemed unsurprised hed expected some strange visions or dreamsthose were symptoms among participants in the initial trials after all if those people had experienced anything as surreal yet visceral as i had…then either elliot was deliberately downplaying the effectsperhaps to test the extent to which that was real or merely a placebo effector his dad had mislead elliot the mechanical clinical part of my mind noted that leaving the rest of me to struggle with what id experienced it felt distant and yet immediate was i seeing behind the veil that shrouded the world an old adage kept playing in my mind incessantly tormenting me things are not as they appear to be that sentiment manifests in a thousand ways dont judge a book by its cover or looks are deceiving there was a vague latent threat in that concept it was one that i think id always been aware of but had never been forced to acknowledge someone somewhere was pushing my head closer and closer to a ferocious flamei could feel the heat as if it were over my entire body sweat cascading in its attempts to buffer the intensity the fire searing itself into my eyes through my eyelids leaving an impression that i could never truly deny or forget was that the way the world truly was the brutality the bloodshed the despairelliot asked me if i was okay i told him that the visions had interfered with my sleep and that id be just fine a gentle lieone that would fester beneath my skin and eat away at me but not hurt elliot hed never know that i had deliberately lied to him about thata party thats what he suggested it would help take my mind off of things there was a big one going down on fridayso id have to wait a couple days if i could manage thator if i really needed something right now elliot told me he could throw something tonighti must have looked really terrible for elliot to suggestor mandatethat because he knew that i wasnt enthusiastic about parties but that was also just the kind of person that elliot was when someone needed something or someone elliot would do what he could to help them hes so fucking nice that i assume people who dont really know him would peg him as a selfrighteouschristian type and the fact that he was a dealer kept him in among the more discriminating pretentious social cliques when he wasnt talking to me he spent most of his time talking to some of our schools most soughtafter girls whether they were the haughty queen bees or the shyyetattractive girls who inspire librarian fantasies elliot was on good terms with both of themalthough he seemed to prefer the latter in my experience hed hook up the jocks with their anabolic steroids of choice and hed always have a couple different stimulants on hand for anyone who was getting uncomfortably close to slowing down id even heard some rumors that hed dealt to a teacher or two but elliot always sternly denied their veracity when he whistled people would comewhenever and however many he wantedthats why when he offered to put something together i didnt say no he rattled off names a few of which i even recognizedhelena isabelle arlene and carris who were some of those gorgeous girls i mentioned before i was threatening to crumble beneath the sheer weight of everything that was happening i still didnt know how to make sense of my nightmare the nature of the beasts its connection to the medication or my moving toeand now i had to contend with a party of sortsnows probably a good time to mention that ive never been one for parties because ive never done very well socially spending time with most people makes me feel like im some kind of novelty on display everyone gets really excited to introduce their crippled friend because im tangible proof of their goodness and their charity thats all i am to most peoplea means to demonstrate their moral superiority to further their social statuselliot has never made me feel that way maybe its because thats just how he is but i think its because we became friends when we were both so young that meaningless social posturing was something i couldnt even conceive of now i know betterthe next three days passed without any significanceinterview january 13th presenti take a deep breath wells looks like hes reviewing his notes the guy writes faster than anyone ive ever seen sometimes when im feeling bored i like to test how quickly he can scribe so far i havent been able to outpace him with my spoken words im starting to feel like i probably couldnt even outpace him with my thoughtsmaybe thats why he was assigned this shit job of babysitting mewells glances up at me while absentmindedly shuffling his notes against the tablewhyd you stop kid he nearly sounds sincerebut i fucking hate it when people call me kid it must be terribly onerous for them to venture all the way down from their high horsedont call me that it comes out harder than i had intendedor what kid wells expression is one of mild amusement but his hands have acquired a sudden tensiona subtle twitch in his wrist and a curling of his fingers i can tell he wants to reach toward something in his right breast pocket without my time in exile these are things i never would have noticedthat depends purely hypothetically who do you think is fastersomeone physically crippled or someone mentally handicappedhis jaw tightened so slightly that it wouldve been imperceptible to me before his right eyebrow began to twitch rhythmically he noticed it after the third beat then stopped it coldi am starting to develop a twisted sense of respect for this manhes becoming a worthy adversary to me every time that impression starts to rear its ugly head i squash it down it feels like playing whackamole except that its less fun because i dont have a plastic hammeri think the fastest wells says quietly would be you finishing your story that way i wont have to think about an answer to the other questiona vicious threat served with a coat of ambiguitysocially acceptablebut theres something about it that i cant quite put my finger on i start to grin at him maybe even smile a little im trying not to chuckle so much as to be insulting…what wells asks harshly the inflection is a condemnation in and of itself i know that hes packing heat a gun the one piece of shit that renders all physical mastery utterly futile but im trying to be less bitter about itthe other thing is he knows that i know hes armed he assumes that the unspoken threat of a gun is the most potent form of power that he can exercise over me of all projectiles bullets are easily the worst theyre even worse than sperm in their capacity to ruin lives but thats not saying muchare you sure you dont want to know the answer i ask airily wells curls the fingers of dominant handhis left hand because hes a little strangeand all of the knuckles pop in unisonto people who havent experienced any true violence in their liveswhich is to say 99% of the population in all firstworld countrieswould probably be intimidated by this in a way i wouldnt even blame them it wasnt all that long ago that i would have fallen in right beside them demanding that others do violence on my behalfid keep my hands clean and the problem would be taken care of then id have return to my uneventful impersonalized and entirely insignificant life on some level all of that still makes a degree of sense to meuntil the real world reasserts itself and kicks you in the teeththen you remember that the type of world youre pretending to be apart of exists only in lighthearted fairy tales and childrens storiesim still struggling with that on some level but im convinced that if i ignore it long enough it will lose interest in me and meander off to pester some other motherfucker i never would have used that word before even when i started to my mother would cry at the violation of propriety and my father would beat me until he felt satiatedon the fourth floor of our house i heard myself saying i shuddered but there was nothing to do but go on theres an absurdlygigantic tub for bathinga disconcerting cross between a common hot tub and midsize swimming pool my father had it installed shortly after my sixth birthday i vaguely remember him saying hmm yes i suppose it is a present for you it was installed in two short days since then ive spent time in it every two or three days ice baths are good for helping muscles recovery from strains and bruising my father has nothing but good things to say about the investment my last words echo in my ears and i realize my voice has gone monotonous all of the life dripping out of itthe second night october 6th pastit was about a month before i was willing to try the medication again while it had the potential to fix my life the danger had felt real enough to upset me at my core what would be the point of gaining the ability to walk and stand on my own if i got killed before i could fully enjoy itelliot had pressed me several times as to the results initially id told him that i hadnt noticed any effects but that it had really messed with my sleep hed seemed disappointed but wasnt easily put off once or twice a week hed ask if i wanted more i was starting to wonder if his dad was putting
