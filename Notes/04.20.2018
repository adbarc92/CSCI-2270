- Binary heap - any parent nodes has higher priority than its children
	- Linked List
	- Array
		- Root = 1
		- RootLC = 2
		- RootRC = 3
		- LCLC = 4
		- LCRC = 5
		- RCLC = 6
		- RCRC = 7
		- Parent of a given K is K/2, so long as zero is left unoccupied ( int automatically rounds down )
		- Left child is 2K
		- Right child is 2K + 1
		- Sort by max = max heap; min = min heap
			- Project is min heap
	- Heap
		- If child has greater priority than parent, then the child/parent swap
